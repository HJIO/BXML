##  layout
###   baseline
A number called "baseline" must 
be set up correctly in 
every Bella page.(default 40px)  
what does _baseline_ mean?  
The body of a bella page is divided into 24 parts
, so you can guess that the _baseline_ is the width 
of each part, so try set up a suitable number.
### raw
*raw-{WIDTH}  
create a raw with width multiplied baseline by _WIDTH_
*raw-f
create a full-body width(24 * baseline) raw.  
*raw-w  
create a full-screen width(100%) raw.
